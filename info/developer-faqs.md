### General information
**What type of applications can I build on Poynt?**<br>
First, from the platform/technology perspective -- the PoyntOS SDK lets you build on-terminal apps that the merchant can interact with in the
store environment. With the Poynt RESTful Cloud APIs, you can also build powerful standlone backend applications, or backend apps that connect to
apps installed on the terminal. Poynt provides you with a comprehensive set of [resources](https://poynt.com/docs/api/) to build the best solutions
for merchants -- [orders](https://poynt.com/docs/api/#orders-index), [transactions](https://poynt.com/docs/api/#transactions-index)
