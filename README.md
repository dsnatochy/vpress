This was great, but we are finally nearing the point where we need to provide more relevant content. I think it's time we talked about Ember, Vue and React and compared all three. Let alone Angular. I don't know who else is using Angular at this point, but since it originated at Google I am sure some G engineers still use it and are working on releasing Angular 2. Ember has a bit of a learning curve. You start with nothing and boom! You have to learn so much. Lots of things don't make sense and are implicit.
