* Once youâ€™re registered, you will see Poynt Developer dashboard.
    - All developers by default are assigned their default developer organization so they can invite other teammates to join and access the same applications. You can try this out later after setting up your device.

* On the dashboard, go to `Test Merchants` and create a test merchant for your development activity. You can change the name, but for testing purposes we recommend to keep the default `Bank` as all transations will be going against our test environment.<br/>
