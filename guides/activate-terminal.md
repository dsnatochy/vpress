# Activate Poynt Terminal

Once you receive your Poynt Developer Unit, follow the instructions below to set it up with a test merchant that you can use to simulate a merchant and start integrating with our PoyntOS SDK and Cloud APIs.

#### Pre-requisites
- Android SDK with android-api 19 (Kitkat) installed on your development machine
- Poynt Developer Unit
- If you want to have the ability to install development applications (APKs) on your device [enable developer-mode](/guides/enable-developer-mode/) (May not be required if your unit arrived already in developer mode).
